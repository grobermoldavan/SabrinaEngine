- sound system
- mesh loading
- font rendering and ui
- resource system
- ecs (?)
- texture multisampling
- texture mipmapping


- finish mesh asset implementation (minimizing and maximizing)
- add support for big texture copies in se_vk_texture_construct. Currently we're bound to the size of the staging buffer. We can handle this by copying big images piece by piece in multiple iterations
- add packed data types for rendering. Pack two floats into a single uint32_t value etc
- add cursor snapping
- add cursor hide/show functions
- add option for enabling/disabling automatic gamma-correction in swap chain texture. add this to engine settings. this will be useful if we want to do gamma correction ourselves
