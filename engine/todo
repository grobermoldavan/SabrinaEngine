- sound system
- mesh loading
- font rendering and ui
- resource system
- ecs (?)
- texture multisampling
- texture mipmapping


- data proveders leak memory when they have FROM_FILE type - file path is not cleared and string is always stays allocated.
  this can be solved by storing some sort of unique file index instead of full path.
- add packed data types for rendering. Pack two floats into a single uint32_t value etc
- add cursor snapping
- add cursor hide/show functions
- add option for enabling/disabling automatic gamma-correction in swap chain texture. add this to engine settings. this will be useful if we want to do gamma correction ourselves
